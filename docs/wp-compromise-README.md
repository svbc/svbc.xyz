# WordPress - Compromise
This repository is used to build WordPress distributions for deployment from git. It is called **compromise** because it contains plugins that do something creepy, like rely on a closed, propietery third-party service, but are considered critical enough that they don't get sent directly to the [creepy](https://allthe.codes/webcraft/wp-creepy) repo. Currently it just contains the [Akismet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akismet) plugin, which effectively combats comment and other kinds of spam, but is not a free and open service.
