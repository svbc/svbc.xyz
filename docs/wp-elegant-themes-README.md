# WordPress - Elegant Themes
This repository is used to build WordPress distributions for deployment from git. It contains themes from [Elegant Themes](http://elegantthemes.com/). We like them a lot, especially [Divi](http://elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/). 

* [Divi](http://elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) - An omni-theme, can be used for a variety of sites, with strong alternative layouts and a killer page builder.
* [Origin](http://elegantthemes.com/gallery/origin/) - Primarily for portfolio sites, with a strong use of featured images and a grid layout.
