# WordPress - Creepy
This repository is used to build WordPress distributions for deployment from git. These are creepy plugins, and if you can, please avoid using them. It contains the following plugins:

* [Google Analyticator](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analyticator/) - Let's Google track you and your precious fellow humans.
* [Jetpack for WordPress](http://jetpack.me/) - Combines functionality you don't need, while slurping up useful plugins like the one that does Markdown. Not that we're bitter.
